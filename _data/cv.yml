#       institution: Korea Electric Power Research Institute, Daejeon, Korea
#       year: 2021-2022
#       description:
#         - title: Worked in the robotics department and participated in Development of Integrated Operation Technology for Anti-drone Protection of Electricity Facilities (R20IA03) and built drone detection system to prohibit a drone from coming to an electrical substation. Besides I made autonomous patrol robots using Turtlebot3, Jetson tx1, lidar, and IMU sensor for the electrical substation in Korea Electric Power Research Institute where It is a national research institute established for electricity supply in South Korea.
#           contents:
#             - Cropped out a large video data one by one in 40 frames to prevent overfitting due to similar data and backgrounds. 
#             - Connected AI and robot with ROS programming.
#             - Created an autonomous robot using SLAM algorithm to be mapping and localization, if a person falls, the topic is handed over and checked on the server computer.
#             - Utilize camera calibration and pose estimation.

#       year: 2019-2020
#       description:
#         - title: Participated in projects such as a Whole-Scene 3D Video Reconstruction of General Environments Containing Dynamic Deformation, Reconstruction of Super Resolution 3D Shape Using Multi-Projector, Visual Memory Storage and Collection Networking in Professor Lee Min-sik's 3D computer vision laboratory.
#           contents:
#             - Created a hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm by Euclidean distance to understand PointNet++ dissertation.
#             - Preprocessing data, converting the 3D point cloud to a 2D image using intrinsic and extrinsic matrix.
#             - The converted 2D image’s background acting as noise was removed using the Solov1 instance segmentation algorithm.
#             - The data removed noise background was used to increase detection accuracy with both MMDetection and Detectron2 algorithms.
#             - Visualized 3d embedding space to compare prediction to ground truth.
